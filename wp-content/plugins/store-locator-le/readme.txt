If you are a plugin developer you will be interested in the new "Roll Your Own" program where you can create SLP based premium (or free) add-ons of your own.   Create something great and list it on our site!

= Support =

Support for the plugin can be found in the [WordPress Forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/store-locator-le).  If you have an urgent issue or want one-on-one support you can [purchase premium support](http://www.charlestonsw.com/product/product-support).

You can also view the [CSA Product Documentation](http://www.charlestonsw.com/support/documentation) for more information about the plugin including [known conflicts](http://www.charlestonsw.com/support/documentation/technical-documentation/store-locator-plus/troubleshooting/known-conflicts/) with themes and plugins.

= Special Requests =

I accept feature requests for all plugins. The most requested features will make it into the next version if time permits.

If you need something NOW, or are looking for something beyond a basic "tweak" of the plugin, please check out the
[Customization Service](http://www.charlestonsw.com/product/customization/).  

= Upgrades and Patches =

I try to release at least one upgrade/patch every month.

The main product will always remain fully functional and free.
If you'd like to have some of the latest "bells & whistles" purchasing a premium add-on is a great way to help support me and encourage even more items get added the next time around.

= My Philosophy =

I strive to create code that runs efficiently and without bugs.
In my opinion, well-written plugins are few and far between.
While there are plenty of plugins that look nice, far too many of those plugins, including the "cool shiny ones" have too many hidden problems.
I have found that over 90% of the plugins available on the WordPress plugin directory generate dozens, if not hundreds, of warnings and errors when you turn off the "hide all the problems" settings.

These hidden problems impact memory usage, fill up disk space, and reduce performance via the typical default logging settings.
While you may not see the errors on your WordPress site, they are still being tracked.
The more errors, the more disk I/O, the slower the app.

During 20+ years of software development, I have found that leaving "innocuous" warnings in place tends to lead to trouble further down the road.
Warnings today often become errors tomorrow.
Many programming languages, PHP included, continue to tighten security and close loopholes that are typically found living near all those warning messages.
Some warnings are telling you to "change this now, it will be gone tomorrow".
Eventually tomorrow will come.

While my plugins may not be the prettiest on the block, I do try to make sure that all the hidden stuff you don't see is designed as well as it can be.
My code is not perfect, but when I find a bug I try to fix it fast. 
If I create a bug I try to fix it even faster.
To sum it all up, I like to write plugins that last.
I hope you appreciate my work.

= Rate This Plugin =

Please [rate this plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/store-locator-le/)!
Rating the plugin, hopefully with 5 stars, helps increase the exposure on WordPress, which generates more downloads and purchases of add-ons.
The more add-ons I sell the easier it is to put food on the table and give me more time to code cool new features.
No ratings, no food, more hours working as the Walmart Greeter, less coolness in the plugins.

Give me a chance to address your concerns if this plugin doesn't earn 5 stars by [contacting me](http://www.charlestonsw.com/mindset/contact-us/) directly or by posting in the [support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/store-locator-le) here at WordPress.

== Installation ==

= Requirements =

* PHP 5.2.4+ (same as WordPress 3.3.2)
* Wordpress: 3.3.2+

= Main Plugin =

1. Upload the `store-locator-plus` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Sign up for a Google Maps API Key for your domain at http://code.google.com/apis/console/
4. Add your locations through the 'Add Locations' page in the Store Locator admin panel
5. Place the code '[STORE-LOCATOR]' (case-sensitive) in the body of a page or a post to display your store locator

= Icons =

The system ships with a dozen default icons in the `/wp-content/plugins/store-locator-le/core/images/icons` directory. Add your own custom icons in that directory and they will be auto-detected.

To prevent custom icons from being over-written they will be copies to the '/wp-content/uploads/sl-uploads/custom-icons/' directory.  If you place your icons in that directory they will be detected on the icon selection screens.

= Custom Styling =

Users that want to customize the look and feel of the search form, map, and search results can do so
with ease using the new Theme System that is part of the Pro Pack.   Copy an existing CSS file,
change the file name and update the CSS header, upload to the server and you can now activate your
new theme or any of the built-in defaults by selecting it from the auto-generated pulldown menu.

Users that opt not to purchase the Pro Pack can still customize the look by editing the basic CSS file that ships with the free plugin.

= Special Thanks =

Thanks to [Nicolas Mollet](http://mapicons.nicolasmollet.com/) and Icons-Land (http://www.icons-land.com/) via Icon Finder for some of the great icons.

== Update Notice ==

3.8.6 update notice.

I have been chasing down some nasty icon (map marker) setting bugs.
Turns out the icons were stored in TWO locations.
Most icons were in both places.
Most places in the code referenced a single location (under ./core/images/icons).
Not EVERYPLACE in the code did so.

Rather than hold up 3.8.6 to make a "perfect patch" I have released this version
with the ability to change/save new home/end icons, save the map height and width,
and a few other settings.

YOU WILL LIKELY NEED TO RE-SET YOUR HOME AND END ICONS.

I cleaned things up and moved all the map marker icons to ./images/icons.

I also fixed the "save custom icons" which runs automatically when updating to a new version.
If you store custom icons in ./core/images/icons or ./images/icons they are now copied to
./wp-content/uploads/slp/saved-icons/.    This may result in a duplicate list of icons in
your icon selector on map settings.   I will at least prevent icons that are in the core
plugin from being copied over in a future release.  For now you may see double icons
in the list.  I think this is better than not saving them at all (older versions) or
not letting people save their map width/height and/or change the map marker icons.

Again: YOU WILL LIKELY NEED TO RE-SET YOUR HOME AND END ICONS.
