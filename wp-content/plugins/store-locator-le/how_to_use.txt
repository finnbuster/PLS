<p>To use Store Locator Plus you only need to add a simple 
shortcode to any page where you want to show a store search form and interactive
map.  For example:<br/>
<code>[STORE-LOCATOR]</code><br/>
<br/>
You can change more details about how the map renders, what options are shown
on the search form, and other details via the admin panel Store Locator Plus
settings panel.   This is also where you'll add or modify location data.
