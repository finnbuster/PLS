After installing the latest version of Event Espresso and the MailChimp addon, please complete the following steps to setup the addon.

* Login to the WP administrator's control panel, and access the "Plugins" dialog.

* Click "Activate" on the Event Espresso - MailChimp Integration plugin

* After clicking "Activate", you will notice a new configuration option in the "Event Espresso" menu. This option is titled "MailChimp Integration".

* By clicking the "MailChimp Integration" link, the system will request a MailChimp API key.

* If an incorrect API key is provided, the system will respond with a detailed error message.

* Once the API key is configured successfully, a "MailChimp List Integration" option will appear in the right menu of the Event Creation and Event Update dialogs, which will allow you to select which MailChimp List to integrate with.

At this point, the MailChimp Integration is complete. All new attendees will be subscribed automatically to the MailChimp list selected above.

In addition, if an administrator creates an attendee for an event, that attendee will also be automatically subscribed to the MailChimp list selected above.
